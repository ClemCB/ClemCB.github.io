title: About Me
---

My name is Clem Capel-Bird and I'm a collaborative software developer. I test drive my code, enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams and strive to be continually learning and improving. I'm a tech meetup organiser and enjoy bringing people together.

I've set up a simple blog to write about things which interest me throughout my learning journey and career. As with my code, I hope to look back on earlier work and see how far I've come, as blogging of any kind is very much outside of my comfort zone. My single Instagram post from 2019 attests to the fact I'm not used to 'putting myself out there' on a screen, despite my relative confidence away from it.

I've been working as a Full Stack developer for three years and recently switched to a purely Frontend role. I'm excited to specialise and focus my energies on improving my skills in React and CSS - as well as venture into new ground using GraphQL. I hope to return to a Full Stack role, given my (initally suprising to me) interest in databases and data management.

I love that I've found software engineering (albiet a little late). There's no other career for me and I'm excited to share some of the things which make me happy to be doing this job.
