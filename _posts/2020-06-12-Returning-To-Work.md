title: Returning to Work
---

I returned to my desk and job as a software developer at the beginning of June after nine months of maternity leave. Lockdown has meant it’s not the world I expected to return to; catching up with colleagues and projects over Slack and Google Meet instead of in-person over a coffee or in sprint planning meetings, but it’s been surprisingly enjoyable.

There was no cliff-end edge to maternity leave when suddenly I was apart from my little one for hours on end for the first time, commuting two hours a day and thrown back into the noise, smells and busyness of central London. I think this has helped immensely to asway a culture shock as there’s no rush getting to, or leaving, the office and in moments when I need the headspace to step away from a problem, I can spend 5 minutes with my husband and daughter and return to my desk afresh.

### Choice

I chose to become a software developer after several years of ‘falling’ into jobs, one of which led me to work alongside developers. I was curious - and envious - of how much they loved their work, how they collaborated to solve problems too big for just one person and built something they had great pride in as a team.

I am immensely glad I worked hard to turn that curiosity into time spent training as an engineer and, restarting work, I know this industry is exactly where I want to be.

### How I'm getting stuck in

I have been able to get stuck into working towards an immediate, major deadline and use the tools in my kit to have confidence in my code, despite not writing code for some time. The most significant of these is testing. Writing tests gives me the confidence to know where to start solving a problem and the ability to refactor and tweak my work without the fear of committing disastrous mistakes. Adding testing libraries to our team repo was also a way for me to show my colours and commitment to testing as an important, solid engineering tool.

### Looking forward

I’m also excited to be switching to a frontend role, having been full stack for two years. As someone who expected to enjoy frontend, I found myself enjoying backend and database work more, but never quite having the opportunity to get good at either. A change in my team means that I’ll be entirely frontend, working with React. Specialising is exciting for me, I’ve been ready to deep dive into a specialism for at least a year.

Coming back from nine months away, I feel energised and bloody time efficient. I’m ready for the next adventure.
