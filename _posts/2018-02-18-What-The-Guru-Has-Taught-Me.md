title: 13 February 2018 - What the Guru has taught me
---

The 13th February marks one year since I overhauled my career and began retraining as a software developer. On that Monday last year, in a room of strangers, we were welcomed by our coach to Makers Academy and I knew there was nowhere else in the whole world I should be. I was doing something which made sense and I was determined to make it the best experience I'd ever had.

And I’m proud to say I did.

### My biggest learning

A year on, and 8 months into my first role as a software developer, I'm reflecting on an observation which has been building and building: that what you put into this job you get out.

If you want to be the best, you damn well have to work hard, put in the hours and care about this job as, well, more than a job.

### Inspiration

I work with a developer fondly referred to as The Guru by our small team. He single handedly built two major tools our company uses and context and language/framework switches like nothing I've ever seen. With a penchant for JavaScript, these tools are built in Node, Angular, TypeScript and React. But that doesn't slow him down in learning the nuances and writing elegant Elixir or any other programming language should the need arise.

Coding isn't just his job, it's his passion. He'll work his hour commute, late into evenings and the weekends. One day working with him, he talked through everything he was doing from 9am to 7.30pm with only a short break for lunch. And he didn't come across as exhausted. He finds an energy in work I am in awe of.

### Take Away

Although I don’t see myself reaching the lofty heights of The Guru - heaven knows I don’t have the energy - his commitment has taught me a valuable lesson. That in order to truly know my stuff, I have to put in the hours and find the niches I love, which keep me exploring, learning and improving.

And the more I invest in myself, my craft, the better a developer I'll be.
